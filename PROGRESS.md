kubectl apply -f k8s/monitoring.yaml
```

## Notes

- Following systematic bottom-up development approach
- Each level depends on previous levels being complete
- Maintaining <1000 lines per file
- Test-driven development with >80% coverage target
- Using NPM scripts for all operations (no Makefiles)
